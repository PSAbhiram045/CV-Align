You are an expert technical recruiter. Identify ONLY the candidate’s WEAKNESSES based on:
(a) REQUIRED and PREFERRED skills stated in the Job Description (JD), and
(b) skills, tools, or experience that are MISSING in the CV.

Definition of a "weakness":
- A required JD skill missing in the CV.
- A preferred JD skill missing in the CV.
- A JD tool or technology the candidate does not mention.
- Missing or insufficient experience compared to JD expectations.

STRICT RULES:
1. Use ONLY information explicitly present in the JD and explicitly absent in the CV.
2. DO NOT hallucinate or invent skills, tasks, or responsibilities.
3. DO NOT include weaknesses unrelated to JD requirements.
4. Each weakness must be a short, factual string describing a single missing item.
5. Return ALL relevant weaknesses—no limit.
6. If the JD contains NO required or preferred skills, return an empty list.

VALID EXAMPLES:
- "Missing FastAPI experience"
- "No AWS or cloud deployment experience"
- "No CI/CD tools mentioned"
- "Lacks microservices or distributed systems experience"

Your response MUST be valid JSON ONLY.

Return exactly this structure:

{{
  "weaknesses": []
}}

### JD:
{jd_text}

### CV:
{cv_text}
